+ This program was built to get public VPN/Tor subscriptions working again!
- Accessing YouTube, Discord, Facebook, LinkedIn, and X (Twitter) without a VPN
- with some Golden strategies is a nice bonus, but not the main focus of this project.
```

### **`Can this program get VPN subscriptions and even Tor bridges working again in Russia?`**

**It can bring unusable subscriptions back to life.**

**If none of your configurations work, or only one or two out of a long list do - give it a try!**

To use Blacklist VPN subscriptions or connect to Tor bridges, start **Igareck AntiDPI** first. Try the strategies one at a time, then run the ping or latency checks for your subscriptions or bridges in your client.
Some strategies will get more VPN configurations working than others. The best choice depends on your connection, so you will need to try them yourself. Start with the Golden strategies.

For example, Tor bridges can connect faster with **Igareck AntiDPI** running, and obfs4 bridges may work on connections where they previously failed.

### **`How can I check whether Igareck AntiDPI is working?`**

1. First, run a latency test on the blacklist (BL) subscriptions **[BLACK_VLESS_RUS_mobile.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/igareck/vpn-configs-for-russia/refs/heads/main/BLACK_VLESS_RUS_mobile.txt)**, **[BLACK_SS+All_RUS.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/igareck/vpn-configs-for-russia/refs/heads/main/BLACK_SS%2BAll_RUS.txt)**, or **[BLACK_VLESS_RUS.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/igareck/vpn-configs-for-russia/refs/heads/main/BLACK_VLESS_RUS.txt)** over an unrestricted network with **Igareck AntiDPI** disabled.
2. Then enable **Igareck AntiDPI** and select a strategy, starting with **Golden**.
3. Run the latency test in your VPN client again.
4. Compare the results to see how many more configurations are working.
5. **Profit!**

### **`Which VPN/Tor clients are compatible with Igareck AntiDPI?`**

**Any client:** **[Karing](https://github.com/KaringX/karing/releases), [v2rayN](https://github.com/2dust/v2rayN/releases), [Throne](https://github.com/throneproj/Throne/releases), [Clash Verge Rev](https://github.com/clash-verge-rev/clash-verge-rev/releases), [OnionHop V3](https://github.com/center2055/OnionHop/releases), [OnionFruit](https://github.com/dragonfruitnetwork/onionfruit/releases/latest)** and more.

No special settings are required. It simply runs in the background.

### **`What strategies are included? What do Golden and Silver mean?`**

**484 strategies:** 45 Golden + 439 Silver, organized into 23 families.

See **[README_Стратегии_Windows_v1.0.txt](windows/README_Стратегии_Windows_v1.0.txt)** for a detailed guide to all strategies.

Golden strategies may be more effective at bypassing TSPU filtering and can perform better than Silver for VPNs, Tor, and YouTube.

### **`Can I watch YouTube on my PC with Igareck AntiDPI, without a VPN?`**

Yes. In the menu that lets you enter a `strategy number` or `YouTube`, type `YouTube` to run the automatic strategy check. Strategies marked `PASS` should let you open YouTube in your browser without a VPN.

**The main purpose of `Igareck AntiDPI` is to restore VPN/Tor connectivity. Direct access to YouTube is a nice bonus.** Some Golden strategies may also provide access to Discord, LinkedIn, Facebook, Threads, X.com, and parts of the Tor Project website.

### **`Does a successful YouTube check mean that a strategy will get more VPN configurations working?`**
   
Not necessarily. Passing the YouTube check does not mean a strategy will outperform the others with VPN configurations.

A strategy may fail to provide direct access to YouTube yet still get the most VPN configurations working (respond to latency checks and pass traffic).

### **`What is the program based on, and what makes it useful?`**

The program uses the [Zapret2](https://github.com/bol-van/zapret2) engine developed by [Bol-Van](https://github.com/bol-van).

**Igareck AntiDPI** comes with ready-to-use strategies for bypassing TSPU filtering. You only need to find the one that works best for you, rather than build a strategy from scratch.

The program and its strategies have been tested on mobile and wired internet connections in Russia. It is intended for people using public VPN/Tor subscriptions and accessing YouTube in Russia.

The command-line interface (CLI) is designed for everyday users, with straightforward menus for configuring, selecting, testing, and restarting strategies while the program is running. You do not need to know terminal commands. Just enter the requested `number`, `да`/`нет` (yes/no), or `youtube`; the prompts tell you what to do.

### `Which platforms are supported?`

**[Windows 10/11 x64](https://github.com/igareck/anti-dpi-for-russia/releases)** ★ **[Linux Ubuntu/Debian x64](https://github.com/igareck/anti-dpi-for-russia/releases)** ★ **macOS 26+ ARM64/x64**

An Android version is planned.

<details>
<summary><code> Click to expand </code></summary>

㋡
  
### **1. Run the installer.**

**[INSTALL USING THE EXE](https://github.com/igareck/anti-dpi-for-russia/releases/download/v1.0/Igareck_AntiDPI_CLI_v1.0_Windows_x64.exe)**

Double-click **Igareck_AntiDPI_CLI_v1.0_Windows_x64.exe**.
Approve the request to run as administrator.

**[INSTALL FROM THE ZIP ARCHIVE](https://github.com/igareck/anti-dpi-for-russia/releases/download/v1.0/Igareck_AntiDPI_CLI_v1.0_Windows_x64.zip)**

Extract **Igareck_AntiDPI_CLI_v1.0_Windows_x64.zip**, open the **Igareck_AntiDPI_CLI_v1.0_Windows_x64** folder, and run **УСТАНОВКА.cmd**.
Approve the request to run as administrator.

### **2. Read the `ВНИМАНИЕ` (Warnings) and `ЗАМЕТКИ` (Notes) sections, then press Enter to continue.**

### **3. Choose an installation folder.**

Press **Enter** to use the default folder, **`C:\Igareck_AntiDPI`**.

Or enter a different installation path.

### **4. Choose the engine version by entering its number.**

1 — the most compatible Zapret2 version, pinned to the commit used to test the current release of **Igareck AntiDPI**.

2 — the latest Zapret2 version from the official master branch.

### **5. Enter `yes` (or `да`) to create a desktop folder with shortcuts, installation instructions, and the strategy reference.**

### **6. Wait for installation to finish.**

---
---

*THE PROGRAM STARTS AUTOMATICALLY WHEN INSTALLATION FINISHES.*

*TO START THE INSTALLED PROGRAM AGAIN, USE THE `START_Igareck_AntiDPI` SHORTCUT IN THE `Igareck_AntiDPI` FOLDER ON YOUR DESKTOP, OR RUN `ЗАПУСК_Igareck_AntiDPI_Zapret2.cmd` IN THE INSTALLATION FOLDER.*

---
---

### **7. Enter the number of the active internet adapter to use with the AntiDPI strategies.**

The program recommends an available physical adapter connected to the internet.

On a typical system with a single physical adapter, you can simply press **Enter** to accept the default. The program selects it automatically.

If your system has multiple adapters and you are unsure which one to choose, check them under `Control Panel` → `Network and Internet` → `Network and Sharing Center` → `Change adapter settings`.

### **8. Choose the destination TCP ports whose traffic Zapret2 will intercept.**

`For VPN subscriptions`, select all ports, since configurations in public subscriptions can use many different ports. For a single server, its known TCP port is enough.

`For a Tor bridge`, you can either select all ports or enter the port specified in the bridge configuration.

`For YouTube in a browser without a VPN`, port 443 is sufficient for the browser traffic covered here.

You can enter a single port, a range, a comma-separated combination, or `all` / `все`.

Press **Enter** with the field blank to select all ports (`all` / `все`). Example: `80,443,1000-2000`.

### **9. The strategy table appears.**

### **10. Enter a `strategy number` from the table, or type `YouTube`.**

```diff
The table groups the strategies into families.
The first column contains the family number.
The second column shows the strategy set: Golden or Silver.
Golden strategies may work better than Silver for VPNs, Tor, and YouTube.
The third column contains the family name.
The last column lists the individual strategy numbers.
```

**a. To start an AntiDPI strategy right away**, enter its `number` from the last column on the right.

**b. To check strategies for YouTube access**, enter `youtube` instead of a number. Then enter a range, such as `1-50`, or a single strategy number. To speed up the check, choose how many strategies to test at once: any number from `1` to `5`.

Strategies that pass the check appear as a list: `3 (PASS), 5 (PASS), 4 (PASS), 2 (PASS), 1 (PASS), 6 (PASS), 7 (PASS), 8 (PASS), 9 (PASS), 10 (PASS), 11 (UNSTABLE), 12 (PASS), 13 (PASS), 15 (PASS), 14 (PASS)`

The menu will then ask you to **enter a `strategy number` or `YouTube`** again. Enter the number of a strategy that passed, then press **Enter** to start it. You can now open YouTube in your browser.

```diff
a. Passing the YouTube check does not always mean a strategy works well with VPN configurations.
b. Failing the YouTube check does not mean a strategy will fail with VPNs. It can be the other way around.
c. A strategy may not provide direct YouTube access but may still get the largest number of VPN configurations to work.
```

### **11. Once the strategy is running, test and connect to configurations in your VPN client (Karing is recommended), or check YouTube in your browser without a VPN.**

A VPN configuration that only works with **Igareck AntiDPI**, and does not even respond to a latency check without it, may need 5–20 seconds to begin passing traffic. After connecting to a configuration that passed the check, give it 5–20 seconds before deciding it is not working.

Use **Igareck AntiDPI** with these **Blacklist VPN subscriptions** (for networks with blacklist-based filtering): **[BLACK_VLESS_RUS_mobile.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/igareck/vpn-configs-for-russia/refs/heads/main/BLACK_VLESS_RUS_mobile.txt)** or **[BLACK_SS+All_RUS.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/igareck/vpn-configs-for-russia/refs/heads/main/BLACK_SS%2BAll_RUS.txt)** or **[BLACK_VLESS_RUS.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/igareck/vpn-configs-for-russia/refs/heads/main/BLACK_VLESS_RUS.txt)**.

### **12. Controls available while the program is running.**

`TO STOP THE CURRENT STRATEGY AND CHOOSE ANOTHER, press F1`

Opens the menu for selecting a strategy or checking YouTube access.

`TO RESTART THE CURRENT STRATEGY, press F2`

Stops the current *winws2.exe* process and starts a new one with the same strategy and adapter.

`TO CHANGE THE NETWORK ADAPTER OR PORTS, press F3`

Stops the current *winws2.exe* process and displays the available active physical IPv4 adapters, including the recommended adapter.

You can then choose the TCP ports whose traffic Zapret2 will intercept.

The new process starts with the same strategy.

`TO STOP AntiDPI/ZAPRET2 AND EXIT, press CTRL+C`

Stops the current *winws2.exe* process and exits the program.

### **13. Running or uninstalling the program.**

**To run:**

1. Use the **START_Igareck_AntiDPI** shortcut in the **Igareck_AntiDPI** folder on your desktop.
2. Run **ЗАПУСК_Igareck_AntiDPI_Zapret2.cmd** in the installation folder.

**To uninstall:**

1. Use the **DELETE_Igareck_AntiDPI** shortcut in the **Igareck_AntiDPI** folder on your desktop.
2. Run **УДАЛИТЬ_Igareck_AntiDPI_Zapret2.cmd** in the installation folder.
